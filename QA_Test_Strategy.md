# QA Test Strategy Document

## 1. Cross-Platform Test Approach

### Unified Testing Framework
- **Framework Selection**: Utilize cross-platform testing frameworks like Appium, Detox, or Flutter Driver that support both iOS and Android
- **Shared Codebase**: Maintain 70-80% shared test code between platforms with platform-specific implementations only where necessary
- **Platform-Specific Testing**:
  - **iOS**: Focus on Safari/WebKit rendering, App Store guidelines compliance
  - **Android**: Cover diverse OEM implementations, permission handling
  - **TV**: Test remote control navigation, focus states, and 10-foot UI experience

### Test Coverage Matrix
| Test Type       | iOS | Android | TV     |
|-----------------|-----|---------|--------|
| Unit Tests      | ✓   | ✓       | ✓      |
| Integration     | ✓   | ✓       | ✓      |
| UI/UX          | ✓   | ✓       | ✓      |
| Accessibility  | ✓   | ✓       | ✓      |
| Performance    | ✓   | ✓       | ✓      |
| Payment Flow   | ✓   | ✓       | (N/A)  |

## 2. Regression vs. Sanity Suite Planning

### Regression Suite
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of all critical functionality
- **Scope**: 100% of core features + edge cases
- **Frequency**: Nightly/Sprintly
- **Execution Time**: 4-6 hours (parallel execution)
- **Environment**: Staging/Pre-Prod

### Sanity Suite
- **Purpose**: Quick validation of critical paths
- **Scope**: 20-30% of most critical user journeys
- **Frequency**: Per PR/Merge Request
- **Execution Time**: < 30 minutes
- **Environment**: QA/Staging

## 3. CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: QA Test Pipeline
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, windows-latest]
        platform: [ios, android]
        exclude:
          - os: windows-latest
            platform: ios

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test -- --platform=${{ matrix.platform }}
```

### Pipeline Stages
1. **PR Validation**:
   - Linting
   - Unit Tests
   - Build Verification
   - Sanity Tests

2. **Merge to Develop**:
   - Full Regression Suite
   - Integration Tests
   - Code Coverage Report

3. **Release Candidate**:
   - Performance Testing
   - Security Scanning
   - Cross-browser/device testing

## 4. Device Strategy

### Device Matrix
| Device Type    | Purpose                     | Provider          |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Physical      | Primary testing             | In-house Lab     |
| Emulators     | Development/Quick Testing   | Local/Cloud      |
| Cloud Devices | Scale Testing               | BrowserStack/SauceLabs |
| Beta Devices  | Real-world validation       | TestFlight/Play  |

### Device Coverage Targets
- **Mobile**: Minimum 5 device models per platform (varying OS versions)
- **TV**: At least 2 models per platform (Apple TV, Fire TV, Android TV, Roku)
- **Screen Sizes**: Cover all major breakpoints
- **OS Coverage**: Current + N-1 versions

## 5. Test Data and Environment Management

### Test Data Strategy
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools like Faker, Mockaroo
- **Data Privacy**: PII masking/anonymization
- **Data Reset**: Automated cleanup between test runs
- **Version Control**: Test data stored in version control (without secrets)

### Environment Management
| Environment   | Purpose                    | Data Reset    |
|---------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Dev          | Active development         | Daily        |
| QA           | Manual testing             | On-demand    |
| Staging      | Pre-production validation  | Per release  |
| Production   | Live environment           | N/A          |

### Environment Variables
- Stored in GitHub Secrets/AWS Parameter Store
- Different sets for each environment
- Rotated credentials
- Audit trail for access

## Monitoring and Reporting
- **Test Results**: Automated reporting to TestRail/Xray
- **Defect Tracking**: JIRA integration
- **Test Metrics**:
  - Pass/Fail rates
  - Flaky test tracking
  - Test execution time trends
  - Defect density by component

## Maintenance
- **Test Suite Review**: Quarterly optimization
- **Flaky Test Management**: Automatic quarantine
- **Documentation**: Living document, updated with each release
